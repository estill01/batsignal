# CARRIERWAVE GOODNESS
Go back and install ImageMagick so that you can install RMagick,
so that you can do processing on user-uploaded avatars,
so that you can offer different sized avatars (profile view vs. thumbnail)

will also be good to have for attaching images to Agendas
	as thumbnails
	as part of content?
	etc


# INSTALLING IMAGEMAGICK
	http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-osx.html

	Getting ImageMagick installed will take a long time.
	You have to install RMagick first and build them both; it's beastly.
	But, these are required... to make thumbnail-sized images out of user-uploaded files.
