Forkable Agendas


Do agenda forking
	Or call the "add_child" method:

	parent = Tag.create(:name => 'Parent')
	grandparent.add_child parent

	--
	Note that any other AR fields can be set with the second, optional attributes argument.

	child = Tag.find_or_create_by_path(%w{home chuck Photos"}, {:tag_type => "File"})k



Do rosters / call lists
	watch people
		do activity feed 
	
# PostgreSQL FAQ
Issue:
	If you switch branches and then try to restart PostgreSQL with `postmaster -D .`
	you might get an error that ends in 'PANIC: could not locate valid checkpoint record'.
Fix:
	`pg_resetxlog .; postmaster -D .`


# CARRIERWAVE GOODNESS
Go back and install ImageMagick so that you can install RMagick,
so that you can do processing on user-uploaded avatars,
so that you can offer different sized avatars (profile view vs. thumbnail)

will also be good to have for attaching images to Agendas
	as thumbnails
	as part of content?
	etc


# INSTALLING IMAGEMAGICK
	Step-by-step
	------------
	sudo brew update
		// make sure you have the latest brew
	sudo brew install librsvg
		// this is a biggie but the key step; could take ~1 hr
	brew install -f imagemagick --disable-openmp
	bundle install

	--------
	http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-osx.etml


	eventually, the command is:
	
	this prevents getting a shitty version that segfaults.
	
	Getting ImageMagick installed might take a long time.
	You have to install RMagick first and build them both; it's beastly.
	But, these are required... to make thumbnail-sized images out of user-uploaded files.

	// Out of date?
	Issue:
		After getting ImageMagick, I still couldn't gem install rmagick without getting an error.
	Fix:
		`brew install libmagic`		// <== this is spelled correctly; it's NOT 'ck'
